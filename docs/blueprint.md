# **App Name**: Model Insights

## Core Features:

- Token Generation Chart: Display a bar chart visualizing the token generation of the top AI models over the past year.
- Top 10 Models List: List the top 10 AI models with details like organization, category, provider, tokens generated, value, and change percentage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated violet (#9400D3) for a vibrant data visualization focus. Violet evokes both imagination and analytics.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated purple (#141219) to provide contrast and visual focus. Its brightness will be appropriate for a dark theme.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) for interactive elements, such as buttons and highlighted data points. It is an analogous color to violet (30 degrees to the "left" of the primary color).
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, to provide a clean, modern, readable style throughout the application. This choice will also be suitable for tables, as in this particular case.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons for categories and providers.
- Clear and distinct sections for the chart and the list, ensuring ease of navigation and understanding.
- Subtle transitions when filtering or sorting the data.
